- Hi! I’m @JeanQuadros-phd.
- I'm interested in working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive web experiences. Eager to explore frameworks like React and Node.js for more advanced development.
- Currently, I am working on a personal project for an e-commerce website using React and Firebase. I am excited to learn more about building dynamic user interfaces and integrating payment systems.
- I am always seeking out new learning resources and tutorials to expand my knowledge in web development. Currently, I am exploring online courses, official documentation, and engaging with developer communities to learn from other professionals.
- My goal is to apply my web development skills to build innovative solutions, create my own digital business, and pursue freelancing opportunities for website and web application development.
